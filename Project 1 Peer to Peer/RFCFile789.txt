Abstract

   This document redefines selected ICMP messages to support multi-part
   operation.  A multi-part ICMP message carries all of the information
   that ICMP messages carried previously, as well as additional
   information that applications may require.

   Multi-part messages are supported by an ICMP extension structure.
   The extension structure is situated at the end of the ICMP message.
   It includes an extension header followed by one or more extension
   objects.  Each extension object contains an object header and object
   payload.  All object headers share a common format.

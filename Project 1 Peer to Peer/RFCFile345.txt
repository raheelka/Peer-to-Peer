Abstract

   This document redefines selected ICMP messages to support multi-part
   operation.  A multi-part ICMP message carries all of the information
   that ICMP messages carried previously, as well as additional
   information that applications may require.

   Multi-part messages are supported by an ICMP extension structure.
   The extension structure is situated at the end of the ICMP message.
   It includes an extension header followed by one or more extension
   objects.  Each extension object contains an object header and object
   payload.  All object headers share a common format.

   This document further redefines the above mentioned ICMP messages by
   specifying a length attribute.  All of the currently defined ICMP
   messages to which an extension structure can be appended include an
   "original datagram" field.  The "original datagram" field contains
   the initial octets of the datagram that elicited the ICMP error
   message.  Although the original datagram field is of variable length,
   the ICMP message does not include a field that specifies its length.
   Therefore, in order to facilitate message parsing, this document
   allocates eight previously reserved bits to reflect the length of the
   "original datagram" field.
